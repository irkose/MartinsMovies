# MartinsMovies
Project developed in ReactJS using Redux for state management and NPM. 
Project description as follows:
Martin's Movies is a client who reviews movies online. They have moved all of their movies to an online movie database which is only accessible via an API.

They need to:
- build a new listing page to pull all data from their new database
- allow customers to search by different movie attributes which are:
    - Keyword
    - Language (English or Other)
    - Year
- mark a movie as 'watched' so when they open the listing page again in the same browser it will still be marked as 'watched'.

Martin's Movies would like to link the Read More button for each movie off to the IMDB page if the imdb_id is set for a movie. 

He would like the design to match a theme he liked but make all make all links a dead link (eg x) for now:
